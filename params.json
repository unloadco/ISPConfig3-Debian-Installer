{"name":"ISPConfig 3 Ubuntu/Debian Installer","tagline":"An Automated and Easy to use ISPConfig 3 Installer for Ubuntu / Debian.","body":"ISPConfig 3 Installer for Ubuntu/Debian\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThis script will install all of the necessary programs and changes that need to be made to get ISPConfig 3 running successfully. It uses the Perfect Server guide from [Srijan Kishore of HowtoForge](https://www.howtoforge.com/perfect-server-ubuntu-14.10-with-nginx-bind-dovecot-and-ispconfig-3) as the\r\nguide. If you would like, you can manually install all of the things needed using the guides that he has provided. I am just trying to streamline the process. \r\n\r\nThere are some things to note.\r\n\r\n1. I edited your fstab for the Quota installation. I only do this when you select to install Quota. This will not work on OpenVZ containers.\r\n2. I make no guarantees that this will work for you. It should, but I am not responsible for anything that happens to your system. It should be installed on a clean install. If you choose\r\nnot to follow these directions, you are responsible for the damage that you have done.\r\n\r\nInstallation Instructions:\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n1. Run this command:\r\n\r\n\t```bash\r\n\tcd /tmp; wget --no-check-certificate -O ISPConfig3.tgz https://github.com/unloadco/ISPConfig3-Debian-Installer/tarball/master; tar zxvf ISPConfig3.tgz; cd *Installer*; bash install.sh\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n2. Answer the onscreen prompts. The script stops so that you can see the appropriate answers.\r\n3. Enjoy the completed installation.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtra Installation Instructions:\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\n1. Please make sure that you have set the PHP Timezone in the appropriate files.\r\n2. Run this command:\r\n\r\n\t```bash\r\n\tcd /tmp; wget --no-check-certificate -O ISPConfig3.tgz https://github.com/unloadco/ISPConfig3-Debian-Installer/tarball/master; tar zxvf ISPConfig3.tgz; cd *Installer*; bash install.sh\r\n\t```\r\n3. Answer the onscreen prompts.\r\n4. Enjoy the completed installation. \r\n\r\n\r\nTO DO\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSee what other options I can add. Please feel free to submit an issue for any ideas that you have.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to [@dclardy64](https://github.com/dclardy64) for making [this great script](https://github.com/dclardy64/ISPConfig-3-Debian-Installer/). It wouldn't be possible without him.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
